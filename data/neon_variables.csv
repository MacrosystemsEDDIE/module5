Precipitation,Precipitation,precip,,"Precipitation is observed using one of two sensors. Primary precipitation is observed using a weighing gauge housed within a small double fence intercomparison reference, which is generally located within 0.5 km of the tower infrastructure. Secondary precipitation is observed using a tipping bucket located on the top of the tower infrastructure. Ground level precipitation (also known as throughfall) is also observed using tipping buckets at 3 of 5 soil array locations. Bulk precipitation is determined at five- and thirty-minute intervals for primary precipitation and at one- and thirty-minute intervals for secondary precipitation. AIS sites only include Primary (DFIR at Core Aquatic sites; currently only 2 or 3) or Secondary (tipping buckets at relocatable sites; currently about 8).
