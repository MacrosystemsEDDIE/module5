intro_eco_forecast,"Ecological forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting changes in populations, communities, and ecosystems. Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasters develop and update forecasts using the iterative forecasting cycle, in which they make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; and use the model to make a forecast of future conditions. When observations become available, they can assess the accuracy of their forecast, which indicates if their hypothesis is supported or needs to be updated before the next forecast is generated."
this_module,"In this module, students will apply the iterative forecasting cycle to develop an ecological forecast for a National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) site. Students will use NEON data to build an ecological model that predicts primary productivity in an aquatic ecosystem. Using their calibrated model, they will learn about the different components of a forecast with uncertainty and compare productivity forecasts among NEON sites."
goal,"The overarching goal of this module is for students to learn fundamental concepts about ecological forecasting and build a forecast for a NEON site. Students will work with an R Shiny interface to visualize data, build a model, generate a forecast with uncertainty, and then compare the forecast with observations. The A-B-C structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels and course structures."
EDDIE,"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules."

act_B,Activity B: Generate a forecast with uncertainty using your model
act_C,Activity C: Apply a forecast to a different NEON site and compare the different forecasts
what_forecast,A forecast is a prediction of future conditions with uncertainty.
why_forecast,We forecast because it help us to make decisions and the information is used to plan for the future.
how_forecast,This module will guide you through the key steps within the forecast cycle and explain how we create ecological forecasts.
eco_forecast1,An ecological forecast is a prediction of future environmental conditions with uncertainty.
eco_forecast2,"An ecological forecast predicts changes in ecosystems in response to environmental drivers such as weather conditions, pollution, or habitat change. It also provides information about how people, economies, and communities may be affected. Local authorities and members of the public use these early warnings to make decisions to protect the health and well-being of a particular area."

workflow1,"After the instructor completes the PowerPoint presentation, students will launch the Shiny app. Students work in pairs to navigate through the upper tabs (e.g., ""Introduction"", ""Exploration"", ""Activity A"", ""Activity B"", and ""Activity C"")  to complete each of the objectives embedded within each tab. Within each activity tab, there are individual objectives which must be completed before moving onto the next one (e.g., within Activity A, Objective 1 is ""Select and view site"")."
workflow2,There are questions in green text boxes embedded throughout the Shiny app which students can  input answers into.
workflow3,"When all of the objectives are completed and questions are answered, navigate to the ""Generate Report"" section in the ""Introduction"" tab. This will then create a Microsoft Word document with all of the forecasts and answers embedded within, which can be downloaded and finalized before submitting to the instructor."
workflow4,"You can save your progress by downloading the user input before you leave the page (see ""Save your progress"" on this webpage for instructions on how to do this). This will allow you to return to this Shiny app and start from where you left off."
obj_01,"Select a NEON site from the table, then click on the ""View live feed"" button to load the latest image from that site. Follow the link at the bottom of the 'About Site' section to find out more about the site."
obj_02,Explore the data measured at the selected site. This is data that has been downloaded from the NEON Data Portal. The variables shown have been selected for this module but there are a wide range of variables collected at each NEON site.
obj_03,We will use chlorophyll-a sensor data to estimate primary productivity. Chlorophyll-a concentrations are an indicator of phytoplankton abundance and biomass. Explore the options below to see if there are any relationships between chlorophyll-a and the other variables measured at your site. This information will be used to build your model.
obj_04,"Using your understanding of aquatic ecosystems, you will build a simple ecological model to predict primary productivity."
obj_05,Test different scenarios with your model to understand how it will respond under different environmental conditions. Use observed data to calibrate the model (i.e. make your model better match observed data).
obj_06,Gain an understanding of what uncertainty is in the context of an ecological forecast and explore weather forecast data. Demonstrate how uncertainty can be quantified.
obj_07,"Using the observed data from the site, you will build a linear model to convert air temperature to surface water temperature and shortwave radiation (SWR) to underwater photosynthetic active radiation (uPAR). This will allow you to then use the weather forecast data to generate a forecast with your ecological model."
obj_08,Use the weather forecast data which has been converted into driving variables (surface water temperature and underwater PAR) to drive the ecological models built in Objective 5 to forecast primary productivity.
obj_09,Forecasts that are effectively communicated to the public and managers will be most useful for aiding decision-making. Here you will think about how to communicate your forecast to an end-user.
obj_10,A fundamental part of the forecast cycle is assessing how well your forecast performed relative to observations. Here we will use a simple assessment of plotting forecast results against observations.
obj_11,Update our model/hypothesis to improve our forecasts based on the recent observations that have been collected. Ecological forecasters call this recalibration of a model.
obj_12,"The forecast cycle is an iterative process. Now after communicating and assessing our forecast and updating our model, we will now generate the next forecast. Ecological forecasters call this data assimilation because data are ""assimilated"" to update the initial conditions."
obj_13, Make a hypothesis about how you expect your model to forecast primary productivitiy at a different NEON site. Then test your hypothesis by repeating Activity A Objectives 1 & 5 and Activity B with the other NEON site.
weather_forecast1,A weather forecast is probably the most widely used and applied forecast. Here we will examine the output from a weather forecast model from NOAA.
weather_forecast2,"Weather forecasts use multiple simulations from the same model, but alters the initial conditions of the model to generate different potential futures."
model1,"A model is a representation (physical, conceptual or mathematical) of a real phenomenon that is difficult to observe directly."
model2,"Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship such as, ""warmer air temperature causes warmer lake surface temperature"" or ""a higher number of wolves leads to a lower population of deer""."
model3,"Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems."
mod_desc,The model we will be using in this module is the nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model. The nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model is a common tool in freshwater and marine research. The NP model represents the simplest sets of processes needed to model plankton dynamics.
phyto_chla,"Phytoplankton are primary producers. They take up nitrogen and other nutrients to photosynthesize (i.e., use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water). Chlorophyll-a is used as a proxy (i.e. indirect measurement) of the phytoplankton concentration in water. We will use chlorophyll-a  sensor measurements from the lake and assume the concentration of chlorophyll-a is equal to the concentration of phytoplankton for the purposes of this module."
ens_mod1,Ensemble modelling is using multiple simulations to predict an outcome and to reduce the error of the prediction.
uncert1,"Uncertainty comes from natural variation and imperfect knowledge. For example, taking replicate samples is one way to estimate uncertainty in observations  whereas imperfect knowledge is reflected in our models, such as the NP model. This model, like many other ecological models, makes assumptions that we know are simplistic representations of reality. One such assumption is that phytoplankton nutrient uptake occurs at a constant parameter rate. It is known that many different species of phytoplankton take up nitrogen at different rates but to reduce model complexity one rate is assumed for all phytoplankton. In addition to process (model) uncertainty, observational uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty, other sources of uncertainty are drivers and initial conditions."
driver_uncert,"Driver uncertainty comes from uncertainty related to the variables used to drive the model. The key driver variables of our NP model are surface water temperature and underwater photosynthetically active radiation (uPAR). To generate a forecast of future productivity, we need to forecast these driver data (using relationships between air temperature and surface water temperature and uPAR and incoming short-wave radiation) and then use those forecasted driver values  to drive the model."
param_uncert,"Parameter uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in the model parameter values, which can be due to uncertainties in the data or the calibration process used."
init_uncert,Initial conditions uncertainty refers to uncertainty arising because the initial conditions are not precisely known or because the calculations cannot be performed with the precise initial conditions.
comm_forecast,Answer Q 23 in the student handout.
state_var,"State variables are those that give a snapshot of the system's properties at any single point in time. The phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentration of an ecological model are examples of this. You can measure them, and you don't need any information about precisely how the system arrived in its current state."
parameter,A parameter is a variable describing the rate of change in those states.
fc_cycle_end,"We have now stepped through each of the steps in the forecast cycle. As you can see, forecasting is an iterative process. We constantly will need to generate forecasts of the future as time moves forward. When we combine our forecasts with data, we can use this data to update our model, which will then improve our model the more forecasts we make. This is one of the key advantages of ecological forecasting."
phenocam,A 'phenocam' is a digital camera capturing time-lapse images of foliage and lake sites. It can be used to generate quantitative measures of plant phenology.
privacy_policy,This Shiny App does not collect or store any of your data.

linear_regression,"Linear regression models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable (x) is a predictor variable, and the other is a response variable (y). For example, we will model surface water temperature (the response variable) using air temperature as a predictor variable."
