intro_eco_forecast,"Ecological forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting changes in populations, communities, and ecosystems. Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasters develop and update forecasts using the iterative forecasting cycle, in which they make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; and use the model to make a forecast of future conditions. When observations become available, they can assess the accuracy of their forecast, which indicates if their hypothesis is supported or needs to be updated before the next forecast is generated."
this_module,"In this module, students will apply the iterative forecasting cycle to develop an ecological forecast for a National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) site. Students will use NEON data to build an ecological model that predicts primary productivity. Using their calibrated model, they will learn about the different components of a forecast with uncertainty and compare productivity forecasts among NEON sites."
goal,"The overarching goal of this module is for students to learn fundamental concepts about ecological forecasting and build a forecast for a NEON site. Students will work with an R Shiny interface to visualize data, build a model, generate a forecast with uncertainty, and then compare the forecast with observations. The A-B-C structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels and course structures."
EDDIE,"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules."
Macro,Macrosystems ecology is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales. Our interdisciplinary team is developing flexible classroom modules that introduce undergraduate students to the core concepts of macrosystems ecology and simulation modeling through the lens of limnology.
act_A,"Activity A: Students visualize data from a selected NEON site, which is used to build a simple ecological model"
act_B,Activity B: Students use their model to generate a forecast with uncertainty
act_C,Activity C: Students then apply a forecast to a different NEON site and compare the different forecasts
what_forecast,A forecast is a prediction of future conditions with uncertainty.
why_forecast,We forecast because it help us to make decisions and forecasts are used to plan for the future.
how_forecast,This module will guide you through the key steps within the forecast cycle and explain how we create ecological forecasts.
eco_forecast1,An ecological forecast is a prediction of future environmental conditiond with uncertainty.
eco_forecast2,"An ecological forecast predicts changes in ecosystems and ecosystem components in response to an environmental driver such as climate variability, extreme weather conditions, pollution, or habitat change. It also provides information about how people, economies, and communities may be affected. Local authorities and members of the public use these early warnings to make decisions to protect the health and well-being of a particular area."
LO1,Describe an ecological forecast and the forecasting cycle
LO2,Explain how forecasting can be used to advance both our understanding of ecological processes  and natural resource management
LO3,Explore and visualize NEON data using an R Shiny interface
LO4,Use a simple box model to generate forecasts of ecosystem primary productivity with uncertainty
LO5,Adjust model parameters and inputs to study how they affect forecast performance relative to observations
LO6,Compare productivity responses to forecasts among NEON sites in different ecoclimatic regions
workflow1,"Instructor gives a brief PowerPoint presentation that introduces ecological forecasting, the iterative forecasting cycle, forecast uncertainty, and a basic ecosystem productivity model."
workflow2,"Students divide into pairs. Each pair selects their own NEON site and visualizes their site's data, which is used to build and calibrate an ecosystem productivity model (Activity A). The two students within a pair each build their own model with unique inputs and parameters to compare the performance of two different models for the same ecosystem."
workflow3,The instructor then introduces Activity B using a few PowerPoint slides.
workflow4,"Students work in pairs to create hypotheses about how they expect their site's productivity to change in the future, forecast the productivity using each model, and investigate how the forecast uncertainty changes with different model inputs and parameters (Activity B). Students first compare their forecasts with their partner's and then revisit their initial hypotheses to see if they are supported or need to be updated."
workflow5,Student pairs then apply their ecological model to a second NEON site (the same site that the other team in their breakout room is working on) and generate ecological forecasts for this second site using their initial productivity model (Activity C). The students work together in a group to present the results from their two sites and two different models and discuss why the forecasts are similar or different among the different sites and models.
obj_01,"Select a NEON site from the table, then click on the icon to load the latest image from that site. Follow the link at the bottom of the 'About Site' section to find out more about the site and fill in the blanks in Q6 in your student handout."
obj_02,Explore the data measured at the selected site. This is data that has been downloaded from the NEON Data Portal. The variables shown have been selected for this module but there are a wide range of variables collected at each NEON site
obj_03,For our measurements of primary productivity we will be using the data from the Chlorophyll-a sensor. Using the options below explore if there are any relationships between Chlorophyll-a and the other variables. This information will be used to build the model.
obj_04,"Using your understanding of primary production within aquatic ecosystems, you will build a simple ecological model to represent the processes observed."
obj_05,Test different scenarios with your model to understand how it will respond under different scenarios. Use observed data to calibrate the model (i.e. make your model match the observed data).
obj_06,Gain an understanding of what uncertainty is in the context of an ecological forecast and explore weather forecast data. Demonstrate how uncertainty can be quantified.
obj_07,Use weather forecast data to drive the calibrated ecological model built on the 'Build Model' tab to forecast primary productivity.
obj_08,Forecasts that are effectively communicated to the public and managers will be most useful for aiding decision-making. Here you will think about how to communicate your forecast to an end-user.
obj_09,A fundamental part of the forecast cycle is assessing how well your forecast did to observations. Here we will use a simple assessment of plotting forecast results against observations.
obj_10,Update our model/hypothesis to improve our forecasts based on the recent observations that have been collected.
obj_11,The forecast cycle is an iterative process. Now after communicating and assessing our forecast and updating our model we will now generate the next forecast.
weather_forecast1,A weather forecast is probably the most widely used and applied forecast. Here we will examine the output from a weather forecast model from NOAA.
weather_forecast2,"Weather forecasts use multiple simulations from the same model, but alter the initial conditions of the model to generate different potential futures. A forecast is a combination of the future condtions and the uncertainty associated with it."
model1,"A model is a representation (physical, conceptual or mathematical) of a real phenomenon that is difficult to observe directly."
model2,Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship such as 'Warmer air temperature causes warmer lake surface temperature' or 'a higher number of wolves leads to a lower population of deer'
model3,"Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems."
mod_desc,The model we will be using in this module is the nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) model. The nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) model is a common tool in limnological and oceanographic research. The NPZ model represents the simplest sets of processes that usefully describe plankton dynamics.
ens_mod1,Ensemble modelling is using multiple simulations to predict an outcome and to reduce the generalization error of the prediction.
uncert1,"Uncertainty comes from natural variation and imperfect knowledge. Replicate samples is a methodology to capture uncertainty in measurements whereas imperfect knowledge is reflected in our models, such as the NPZ model. This model, like many other ecological models, makes assumptions. One such assumption is that zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton occurs at a constant rate. It is known that many different species of zooplankton feed at different rates but to reduce model complexity one rate is assumed for the entire group."
driver_uncert,"Driver uncertainty comes from uncertainty related to the variables used to drive the model. The key driver variables of our NPZ model are water temperature, photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and nutrient loading. We do not know what these variables will be in the future but we can use weather forecast data to predict what they will be and then use that to drive the model."
param_uncert,"Parameter uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in the model parameter values, which can be due to uncertainties in the data or the calibration process used."
init_uncert,Initial conditions uncertainty refers to uncertainty arising because the initial conditions are not precisely known or because the calculations cannot be performed with the precise initial conditions.
