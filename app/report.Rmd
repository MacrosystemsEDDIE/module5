# **Macrosystems EDDIE Module 5: Introduction to Ecological Forecasting**


# Learning Objectives:

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe an ecological forecast and the iterative forecasting cycle
- Explore and visualize NEON data using an R Shiny interface
- Construct an ecological model to generate forecasts of ecosystem primary productivity with uncertainty
- Adjust model parameters and inputs to study how they affect forecasts relative to observations
- Compare productivity forecasts among NEON sites in different regions

# Why macrosystems ecology and ecological forecasting?

**Macrosystems ecology** is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales (e.g., Heffernan et al. 2014). For example, _global_ climate change can interact with _local_ land-use activities to control how an ecosystem changes over the next decades. Macrosystems ecology recently emerged as a new sub-discipline of ecology to study ecosystems and ecological communities around the globe that are changing at an unprecedented rate because of human activities (IPCC 2013). The responses of ecosystems and communities are complex, non-linear, and driven by feedbacks across local, regional, and global scales (Heffernan et al. 2014). These characteristics necessitate novel approaches for making predictions about how systems may change to improve both our understanding of ecological phenomena as well as inform resource management.  


**Forecasting** is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting macrosystems dynamics. To anticipate and prepare for increased variability in populations, communities, and ecosystems, there is a pressing need to know the future state of ecological systems across space and time (Dietze et al. 2018). Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasts are a powerful test of the scientific method because ecologists make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; use the model to make a forecast of future conditions; and then when observations become available, assess the accuracy of their forecast, which indicates if their hypothesis is supported or needs to be updated. Forecasts that are effectively communicated to the public and managers will be most useful for aiding decision-making. Consequently, macrosystems ecologists are increasingly using ecological forecasts to predict how ecosystems are changing over space and time (Dietze and Lynch 2019).  
\
In this module, students will apply the iterative forecasting cycle to develop an ecological forecast for a National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) site of their choice. This module will introduce students to the basic components of an ecological forecast; how a forecasting model is constructed; how changes to model inputs affect forecast uncertainty; and how productivity forecasts vary across ecoclimatic domains.  \

## Module overview:

- Introduction to Ecological Forecasting: pre-readings and PowerPoint in class
- Activity A: Visualize data from a selected NEON site and build an ecological model
- Activity B: Generate a forecast and work through each stage of the iterative forecast cycle
- Activity C: Apply a forecast to a different NEON site and compare forecasts among sites
\

## Today's focal question: _What is an Ecological Forecast?_

To address this question, we will introduce ecological forecasts and the iterative forecasting cycle. We will build a model that forecasts aquatic ecosystem productivity in response to multiple environmental factors (e.g., weather, herbivory). We will also examine the uncertainty associated with our forecast predictions, which can originate from multiple sources. In this module, we will use our productivity model to examine how forecast uncertainty is related to driver data, model parameters, and initial conditions. We will then compare productivity forecasts for ecosystems in different ecoclimatic regions to understand how forecasts can vary both over time and space.  
  
We will be using ecological data collected by the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) to tackle this question. NEON is a continental-scale observatory designed to collect publicly-available, long-term ecological data to monitor changing ecosystems across the U.S. Primary productivity in lakes is our focal forecast variable as it governs the biological activity of a lake and is a key indicator of ecosystem health that can change rapidly in response to environmental drivers.   
  
Primary productivity is the process by which photosynthetic organisms (e.g., algae) make their own food from inorganic sources. These organisms use CO2 and solar energy to produce the food they need for their metabolism. Measurement of chlorophyll-a, a photosynthetic pigment, is a common proxy for quantifying aquatic primary productivity.  
  
As the bottom-most trophic level in freshwater ecosystems, primary producers serve an essential role in providing nutrients and energy to higher trophic levels and higher organisms. For instance, zooplankton and fish need to graze on algae in a lake, so a baseline level of algae is needed to support their populations. Low primary productivity may thus hinder the growth of these other organisms by limiting available nutrients and energy. Conversely, extremely high primary productivity may result in algal blooms, which can have detrimental effects on zooplankton and fish because of their scums and toxins. Altogether, an intermediate level of primary productivity may support the most diverse and largest amount of biomass, with some variability across different lakes.
