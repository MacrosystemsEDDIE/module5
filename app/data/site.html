<p>Prairie Lake (PRLA) is an aquatic NEON field site located on the Missouri Coteau approximately 15 km (9.3 mi.) west of Pingree, North Dakota. PRLA sits in a 4.5 km<sup>2</sup> (1112 acre) watershed, on land managed by the State of North Dakota Land Trust. The region includes a patchwork of grasslands, agricultural, and wetland/aquatic communities embedded in a matrix of small agrarian communities. The landscape at PRLA is characterized by rolling hills covered in mixed-grass prairie with a high concentration of wetlands. This site is part of NEON's Northern Plains Domain (D09). D09 has one other aquatic field site and three terrestrial field sites. PRLA is colocated with the Dakota Coteau Field School (DCFS) terrestrial field site. [2] [5]</p>
