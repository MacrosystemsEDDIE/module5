<p>Lake Barco (BARC) is an aquatic NEON field site located in Putman County, Florida about 20 miles east of Gainesville. It is part of the Ordway Swisher Biological Station (OSBS), a 38.5 km2 (9500 acre) property owned and managed by the University of Florida as a biological research center. The lake is clear, with light penetrating through most of its depth. It is 0.13 km2 (32 acres) in area, situated in watershed that is 0.81 km2 (203 acres). It is classified as a seepage lake dominated by groundwater, acting as a discharge and recharge system to the regional Upper Floridian aquifer. It is encompassed within the NEON Southeast Domain that is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. The Domain features a patchwork of forest, grassland, and wetland communities embedded in a matrix that is increasingly dominated by a fast-growing human population. The Domain hosts five other NEON field sites, including two additional aquatic and three terrestrial sites, located in Florida and Georgia. BARC is colocated with the OSBS terrestrial field site. The Suggs Lake (SUGG) aquatic site is also located within the university's OSBS. [9]</p>
