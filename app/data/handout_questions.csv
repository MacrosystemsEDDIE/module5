q4f,f. Elevation (m)
q5,Q5. Fill out the table with the description of site variables:
q5a,Air temperature
q5b,Surface water temperature
q5c,Nitrogen
q5d,Underwater PAR
q5e,Chlorophyll-a
q6,Q6. Describe the effect of each of the following variables on chlorophyll-a. Chlorophyll-a is used as a proxy measurement for phytoplankton concentration and primary productivity in aquatic environments.
q6a,Air temperature
q6b,Surface water temperature
q6c,Nitrogen
q6d,Underwater PAR
q7,"Q7. Describe the relationship between each of these driving variables and productivity? For example, if the driving variable increases, will it cause productivity to increase (positive), decrease (negative), or have no effect (stay the same)."
q7a,a. Surface water temperature
q7b,b. Incoming light
q7c,c. Available nutrients
q8,"Q8. Classify the following as either a state variable or a parameter by dragging it into the corresponding bin. Once you have checked your answers, record the correct answers in the final report."
q9,"Q9. We are using chlorophyll-a as a proxy of aquatic primary productivity. In your final report, describe how you envision each parameter to affect chlorophyll-a concentrations. For example, if the parameter increases, will it cause productivity to increase (positive), decrease (negative), or have no effect (stay the same)."
q9a,a. Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton
q9b,b. Phytoplankton mortality
q10,"Q10. Describe the effect of changing phytoplankton initial conditions on your model run. As you increase or decrease initial conditions, how does this affect modeled primary productivity?"
q11,"Q11. Describe the effect of changing the phytoplankton mortality parameter on your model run. As you increase or decrease mortality, how does this affect modeled primary productivity?"
q12,Q12. Copy-paste the plot you downloaded that shows your calibrated model run into your final report.
q13,Q13. Record the model settings of your best-fit calibrated model in the Q13 table.
q14,"Q14. Add the observations to the plot. Calibrate your model by selecting sensitive variables and adjusting the parameters until they best fit the observed data. Save the plot and the parameters, these are what will be used for the forecast."
q15,Q15. What is forecast uncertainty? How is forecast uncertainty quantified?
q16,Q16. Inspect the weather forecast data for the site you have chosen:
q16a,a. How does increasing the number of ensemble members in the weather forecast affect the size of the uncertainty in future weather?
q16b,"b. Using the interactivity of the weather forecast plot, compare the air temperature forecasts for the first week (Sep 25 - Oct 1) to the second week (Oct 2 - 8). How does the forecast uncertainty change between the two periods? "
q16c,c. Use the 'Save plot' button to save the NOAA forecast plot and copy-paste it into your final report.
q17,"Q17. How does driver uncertainty affect the forecast, and specifically, how does the forecast uncertainty change over time?"
q18,Q18. How does altering the initial condition of your forecast affect forecast output?
q19,Q19. How would you describe your forecast of primary productivity at your NEON site so it could be understood by a fellow classmate?
q20,Q20. Examine the example forecast visualizations below. 
q20a,"a. Which of these visualizations do you think most effectively communicates your forecast, and why?"
q20b,b. Download and copy-paste the visualization that you think best communicates your forecast into your final report.
q21,Q21. Examine the predicted vs. observed plot as well as the value of R2.
q21a,a. How well did your forecast do compared to observations?
q21b,b. Download and copy-paste the forecasted vs. observed plot into your final report.
q22,Q22. Were you able to successfully improve your forecast by updating your model parameters? Explain what you did and how you know whether your forecast has improved.
q23,Q23. Describe the new forecast of primary productivity.
q24,Q24. Why is the forecast cycle described as 'iterative' (i.e. repetition of a process)?
