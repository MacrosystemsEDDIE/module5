intro_eco_forecast,"Ecological forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting changes in populations, communities, and ecosystems. Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasters develop and update forecasts using the iterative forecasting cycle, in which they make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; and use the model to make a forecast of future conditions. When observations become available, they can assess the accuracy of their forecast, which indicates if their hypothesis is supported or needs to be updated before the next forecast is generated."
this_module,"In this module, students will apply the iterative forecasting cycle to develop an ecological forecast for a National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) site. Students will use NEON data to build an ecological model that predicts primary productivity in an aquatic ecosystem. Using their calibrated model, they will learn about the different components of a forecast with uncertainty and compare productivity forecasts among NEON sites."
goal,"The overarching goal of this module is for students to learn fundamental concepts about ecological forecasting and build a forecast for a NEON site. Students will work with an R Shiny interface to visualize data, build a model, generate a forecast with uncertainty, and then compare the forecast with observations. The A-B-C structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels and course structures."

workflow1,"After the instructor completes the PowerPoint presentation, students will launch the Shiny app and download the final report template as a Word document. Students work in pairs to navigate through the upper tabs (e.g., ""Introduction"", ""Exploration"", ""Activity A"", ""Activity B"", and ""Activity C"")  to complete each of the objectives embedded within each tab. Within each activity tab, there are individual objectives which must be completed before moving onto the next one (e.g., within Activity A, Objective 1 is ""Select and view site"")."
workflow2,"There are questions in green text boxes embedded throughout the Shiny app which correspond to the questions in the final report. Students should input their answers into the final report Word document. In addition, students will be cued to download visualizations generated throughout the module and copy-paste them into the final report. "
workflow3,"Once students have completed all three activities, the final report may be submitted to the instructor for assessment."
workflow4,"We encourage you to save your progress regularly by clicking ""Bookmark my progress"" and copying the (quite long!) link to a secure location. When pasted into your web browser, this link will load a Shiny app session that contains your progress."
obj_01,"Select a NEON site from the table, then click on the ""View latest photo"" button to load the latest image from that site. Follow the link at the bottom of the 'About Site' section to find out more about the site."
obj_02,Explore the data measured at the selected site. These are data that has been downloaded from the NEON Data Portal. The variables shown have been selected for this module but there are a wide range of variables collected at each NEON site.
obj_03,We will use chlorophyll-a sensor data to estimate primary productivity. Chlorophyll-a concentrations are an indicator of phytoplankton abundance and biomass. Explore the options below to see if there are any relationships between chlorophyll-a and the other variables measured at your site. This information will be used to build your model.
obj_04,"Using your understanding of aquatic ecosystems, you will build a simple ecological model to predict primary productivity."
obj_05,Test different scenarios with your model to understand how it will respond under different environmental conditions. Use observed data to calibrate the model (i.e. make your model better match observed data).
obj_06,Gain an understanding of what uncertainty is in the context of an ecological forecast and explore weather forecast data. Demonstrate how uncertainty can be quantified.
obj_07,"Using observed data from your lake site, you will build a linear model to convert air temperature to surface water temperature and shortwave radiation (SWR) to underwater photosynthetic active radiation (uPAR), which are the inputs required for your primary productivity model. "
obj_08,Use forecasted water temperature and uPAR and up-to-date initial conditions to drive your calibrated model into the future and forecast primary productivity.
obj_09,Forecasts that are effectively communicated to the public and managers will be most useful for aiding decision-making. Here you will think about how to communicate your forecast to an end-user.
obj_10,A fundamental part of the forecast cycle is assessing how well your forecast performed relative to observations. Here we will use a simple assessment of plotting forecast results against observations.
obj_11,Update our model/hypothesis to improve our forecasts based on the recent observations that have been collected. 
obj_12,"The forecast cycle is an iterative process. Now after communicating and assessing our forecast and updating our model, we will generate the next forecast. "
obj_13, Make a hypothesis about how you expect your model to forecast primary productivitiy at a different NEON site. Then test your hypothesis by repeating Activity A Objectives 1 & 5 and Activity B with the other NEON site.
weather_forecast2,"Weather forecasts are created using multiple runs from the same model, but the initial conditions of the model are altered to generate different potential futures."
model1,"A model is a representation (physical, conceptual or mathematical) of a real phenomenon that is difficult to observe directly."
model2,"Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship such as, ""warmer air temperature causes warmer lake surface temperature"" or ""a higher number of wolves leads to a lower population of deer""."
model3,"Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems."
mod_desc,The model we will be using in this module is the nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model. The nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model is a common tool in freshwater and marine research. The NP model represents the simplest sets of processes needed to model plankton dynamics.
phyto_chla,"Phytoplankton are primary producers. They take up nitrogen and other nutrients to photosynthesize (i.e., use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water). Chlorophyll-a is used as a proxy (i.e. indirect measurement) of the phytoplankton concentration in water. We will use chlorophyll-a  sensor measurements from the lake and assume the concentration of chlorophyll-a is equal to the concentration of phytoplankton for the purposes of this module."
uncert1,"Uncertainty comes from natural variation and imperfect knowledge. For example, taking replicate samples is one way to estimate uncertainty in observations  whereas imperfect knowledge is reflected in our models, such as the NP model. This model, like many other ecological models, makes assumptions that we know are simplistic representations of reality. One such assumption is that phytoplankton nutrient uptake occurs at a constant parameter rate. It is known that many different species of phytoplankton take up nitrogen at different rates but to reduce model complexity one rate is assumed for all phytoplankton. In addition to process (model) uncertainty, observational uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty, other sources of uncertainty are drivers and initial conditions."
driver_uncert,"The driver variables of our primary productivity model are surface water temperature and underwater photosynthetically active radiation (uPAR). However, NOAA provides forecasts of air temperature and shortwave radiation, not water temperature and uPAR. Therefore, to generate a forecast of future productivity, we will convert the NOAA forecast using relationships between air temperature and surface water temperature and shortwave radiation and uPAR. We will use the resulting water temperature and uPAR forecasts to drive your primary productivity model."
param_uncert,"Parameter uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in the model parameter values, which can be due to uncertainties in the data or the calibration process used."
init_uncert,Initial conditions uncertainty refers to uncertainty arising because the initial conditions are not precisely known or because the calculations cannot be performed with the precise initial conditions.
comm_forecast,Answer Q 23 in the student handout.
state_var,"State variables are those that give a snapshot of the system's properties at any single point in time. The phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentration of an ecological model are examples of this. You can measure them, and you don't need any information about precisely how the system arrived in its current state."
parameter,A parameter is a variable describing the rate of change in those states.
fc_cycle_end,"We have now stepped through each of the steps in the forecast cycle. As you can see, forecasting is an iterative process. We constantly will need to generate forecasts of the future as time moves forward. When we combine our forecasts with data, we can use this data to update our model, which will then improve our model the more forecasts we make. "
